[ ] SoC: alu op with mux of register and immediate instead of cases
[ ] SoC: pc module with selectable next value from mux of branch, increment etc
[ ] RAM depth to use all block memory (currently 32 out of 45)
[ ] UartTx and UartRx mapped to upper memory,
[ ]   e.g. byte at 0xffff_fffe for UartTx. UartTx writes zero after transmission of a byte.
[ ]   e.g. byte at 0xffff_fffd for UartRx. cpu writes 0 for UartRx to receive next.
[ ] implement
[ ]     ECALL
[ ]     EBREAK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] Led and rgb at one byte 0xffff_ffff {b,g,r,led[3:0]}
[-]     FENCE.I
[-]     FENCE => not a multithreaded implementation
