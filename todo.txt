[ ] SoC: alu op with mux of register and immediate instead of cases
[ ] Led and rgb at one byte 0xffff_fffd {r,g,b,led[3:0]}
[ ] UartTx and UartRx mapped to upper memory,
[ ]   e.g. byte at 0xffff_ffff for UartTx. UartTx writes zero after transmission of a byte.
[ ]   e.g. byte at 0xffff_fffe for UartRx. cpu writes 0 to for UartRx to receive next.
